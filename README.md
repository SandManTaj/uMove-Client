# uMove - University of Movement

Our goal is to have an application where students of movement can come and have a safe place where they can not only see their movement, but receive corrections as well. Through the use of artificial intelligence and a good framework, we'll be able to start the foundation for a school that empowers its students to become the teachers; with the promise that we will be constantly learning right alongside you.

## Getting Started

To begin learning, all you need is a camera and internet access. Make sure the camera stays as still as possible when taking video or a picture and try to get the whole body in the picture for best results. Being at least 8 feet away is recommended and it's very important to only have a single person in the video for quality results.

### How to access uMove

As of January 20th, 2020, you'll be able to access a web version of uMove by going to the link www.universityofmovement.com or www.umove.app.

In the future we will be working on a frontend for both iOS and Android, so the user can have easier access with a phone.

### How does it work?

With the use of AWS cloud services we're able to have our application be both cheap yet scalable. Every service is run through amazon from the frontend to the backend to the database, so we will also have the same trusted security as huge corporations and even the US government.

Start by making an account and then all you have to do is choose a photo or video from your system and upload to our server and you'll instantly get a response back with your photo and the bodypoints of the target identified. You'll also be given the choice to download the new video if desired.
